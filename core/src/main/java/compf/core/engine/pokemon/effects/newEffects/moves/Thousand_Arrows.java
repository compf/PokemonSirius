/*This move can hit airborne Pokemon, which includes Flying-type Pokemon, Pokemon with the Levitate Ability, Pokemon holding an Air Balloon, and Pokemon under the effect of Magnet Rise or Telekinesis. If the target is a Flying type and is not already grounded, this move deals neutral damage regardless of its other type(s). This move can hit a target using Bounce, Fly, or Sky Drop. If this move hits a target under the effect of Bounce, Fly, Magnet Rise, or Telekinesis, the effect ends. If the target is a Flying type that has not used Roost this turn or a Pokemon with the Levitate Ability, it loses its immunity to Ground-type attacks and the Arena Trap Ability as long as it remains active. During the effect, Magnet Rise fails for the target and Telekinesis fails against the target.*/
