# PokemonSirius

This is an attempt to recreate a simple 2d pokemon game using Java and OOP. The goal is to abstract the several components of a Pokemon game to increase modularity and portability. The game can currently only be played on a computer but doing battle via networks or porting the game to other platfforms should be possible

Currently only simple functionalty like walkign around, starting a battle and  using simple moves is possible but the design should allow adding more functionality relatively easys.
